# taskPlanners
Task planners realized 2 algorithms of planning: FCFS(first come first serve) and HRRN(Highest Response Ratio Next). <br><br>
FCFS executes processes in order of entry and HRRN executes processes in order of the most Response Ratio, that considered as (W+S)/S, where W - Waiting Time and S - Service Time or Burst Time.
